Capstone Project Ideas:

3.	Asylum and Refugee family reunification 
I would like to assess how long the family reunification cases for refugee and asylum currently take. I would also like to answer this question: Is it possible to predict how long an application for asylum might take? Currently thereâ€™s no way for knowing how long these applications will be in "Pending" state.
